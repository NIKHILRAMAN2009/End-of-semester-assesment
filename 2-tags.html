         My name is Nikhil Raman. I am studying Grade 8 at KC High school. 
         I live in Hiranandani, Chennai.
         I was born on May 12 2009, in Mumbai. I am a Taurian by birth. No wonder I am so obstinate!

            KC High is one of the best schools to study in. My favourite subjects in Grade 8 are: 
            Math, Science, Computer Science and Chess. Besides this I enjoy my visits to the cafeteria, basketball court and the library. 
            I am a new student and I'm slowly getting to know the school better and thoroughly loving it.
